# Student Information Management Application


This project includes a student information management application I created using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This application allows you to add, list and delete student information.

## Technical details
I used the following components and technologies to provide information about the building blocks and technical details of the project:

- MongoDB: MongoDB was used as the database. Student information is stored here.

- Express.js: Express.js was used for server-side application. It was used to process HTTP requests and communicate with MongoDB.

- React: React was used for the user interface. Provides a user-friendly interface to view, add and delete student information.

- Node.js: Node.js was used to run on the server side. It works integrated with Express.js and directs requests.
